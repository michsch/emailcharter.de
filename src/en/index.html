      <h2>10 Rules to Reverse the Email Spiral</h2>
    </header>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Respect Recipients' Time</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This is the fundamental rule. As the message sender, the onus is on
          YOU to minimize the time your email will take to process. Even if it
          means taking more time at your end before sending.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Short or Slow is not Rude</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Let's mutually agree to cut each other some slack. Given the email
          load we're all facing, it's OK if replies take a while coming and if
          they don't give detailed responses to all your questions. No one wants
          to come over as brusque, so please don't take it personally. We just
          want our lives back!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Celebrate Clarity</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Start with a subject line that clearly labels the topic, and maybe
          includes a status category [Info], [Action], [Time Sens]
          [Low Priority]. Use crisp, muddle-free sentences. If the email has to
          be longer than five sentences, make sure the first provides the basic
          reason for writing. Avoid strange fonts and colors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Quash Open-Ended Questions</h3>
        </header>
        <p>It is asking a lot to send someone an email with four long paragraphs
          of turgid text followed by "Thoughts?". Even well-intended-but-open
          questions like "How can I help?" may not be that helpful. Email
          generosity requires simplifying, easy-to-answer questions. "Can I
          help best by a) calling b) visiting or c) staying right out of it?!"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Slash Surplus cc's</h3>
        </header>
        <p>cc's are like mating bunnies. For every recipient you add, you are
          dramatically multiplying total response time. Not to be done lightly!
          When there are multiple recipients, please don't default to
          'Reply All'. Maybe you only need to cc a couple of people on the
          original thread. Or none.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Tighten the Thread</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Some emails depend for their meaning on context. Which means it's
          usually right to include the thread being responded to. But it's rare
          that a thread should extend to more than 3 emails. Before sending,
          cut what's not relevant. Or consider making a phone call instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Attack Attachments</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Don't use graphics files as logos or signatures that appear as
          attachments. Time is wasted trying to see if there's something to
          open. Even worse is sending text as an attachment when it could have
          been included in the body of the email.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Give these Gifts: EOM NNTR</h3>
        </header>
        <p>If your email message can be expressed in half a dozen words, just
          put it in the subject line, followed by EOM (= End of Message). This
          saves the recipient having to actually open the message. Ending a
          note with "No need to respond" or NNTR, is a wonderful act of
          generosity. Many acronyms confuse as much as help, but these two
          are golden and deserve wide adoption.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Cut Contentless Responses</h3>
        </header>
        <p>You don't need to reply to every email, especially not those that are
          themselves clear responses. An email saying "Thanks for your note.
          I'm in." does not need you to reply "Great." That just cost someone
          another 30 seconds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <header>
          <h3>Disconnect!</h3>
        </header>
        <p>If we all agreed to spend less time doing email, we'd all get less
          email! Consider calendaring half-days at work where you can't go
          online. Or a commitment to email-free weekends. Or an 'auto-response'
          that references this charter. And don't forget to smell the roses.</p>
