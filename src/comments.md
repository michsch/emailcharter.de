# Comments

We'd love your feedback on the Charter. The main conversations are happening
here and on our Facebook page. Here are some comments on the original draft:

> YES YES YES!
> <footer>- Cindy Gallop</footer>

> Perfect!
> <footer>- Arnold Myers</footer>

> So, it's not just me?
> <footer>- Toma Rusk</footer>

> Great idea mate, this would make my life considerably less stressful,
> especially considering I have to work tomorrow (Saturday here in Oz)
> just to clear the 839 emails and counting that have gotten the better
> of me.
> <footer>- Nathan Frick</footer>

> The average Corporate user sends and receives 110 emails a day!
> <footer>- @davidchris</footer>

> The Charter for Compression?
> <footer>- @REMOrandom</footer>

> I think I like this but I'll get back to you after I get done reading my
> emails
> <footer>- Brent Muth</footer>

> Treat e-mails in much the same way was we did letters, in the 'olden days'.
> I mean, how many of us, the minute a letter dropped onto our doormat
> (or desk), stopped and IMMEDIATELY began composing a response?
> <footer> - Claire</footer>

> The EOM and NNTR tags are genius
> <footer>- Eckie</footer>

> Short is good. Too short is not. Anticipate questions and answer them. Use
> whole words (but not unnecessary ones). Be concise and courteous, but not
> abrupt. Please and thank you are not optional.
> <footer> - David</footer>

> A pet peeve of mine are signatures that are five times longer than the
> message itself....Perhaps the world needs a more universal system of
> short-form legalese.
> <footer>- Jerry</footer>

> Since when did having a job mean having to be available 24/7 to anyone? Let
> your family, friends, co-workers know that you are not chained to your
> computer, or your BlackBerry/iPhone (but don't get me started on cell phone
> etiquette . . . ). It really is okay to just shut down and have some real
> face-to-face time with people every day.
> <footer>- Mary Ann</footer>

> Another rule to consider: pick up the phone
> <footer>- Phoebe</footer>
